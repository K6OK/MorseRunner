### Unique contest behaviors
<!-- Identify any unique contest behaviors that can add to the realism of the contest simulation.
1. Please point out any special requirements that we should know about when adding this contest to Morse Runner.
2. Describe any information regarding the contest exchange that you find special or out of the ordinary. Normally, contest exchanges are very simple. However some contests (e.g. ARRL Sweepstakes) have a more complex exchange that my have special processing within a contest logging program (e.g. N1MM).
3. Please describe any odd behaviors you have observed while operating this contest that would make this contest simulation more interesting. These could be common errors or things that have tripped up your copy during the contest. For example, the Morse Runner 'LID' option will randomly cause some stations to call you when you are working another station, make mistakes when they send code, copy your messages incorrectly, and send RST other than 599. We will consider whether these behaviors can be added to the simulation. -->
