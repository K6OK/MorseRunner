# Contributing to Morse Runner CE
Morse Runner CE is a community-maintained project and we happily accept contributions.
Thank you for your interest in Morse Runner and taking the time to contribute.

We are looking for the following types of people:
- **Maintainers** - Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and
managing the organizational aspects of the project.
(requires collaborator permissions.)
- **Contributors** - Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
They might contribute to coding or testing, write documentation
or develop training materials, etc.
- **Community Members** - People who use the project.
They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the projectâ€™s direction.

Please feel free to join in at whatever level you are comfortable.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Morse Runner CE.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document
in a pull request.

> This file will help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and describes how the process works.

> You should try to build a draft of the CONTRIBUTING.md file with the core contributors to your project to help them feel a shared sense of responsibility and to create the best possible guide for encouraging new contributors. It is sometimes best to practice building a markdown file in an offline program like Mou or an online one like Dilliger before you post it online.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Morse Runner Code of Conduct](TODO https://github.com/w7sst/MorseRunner/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to (TODO).

## What should I know before I get started?

### I'm new to open source software

If you are new to open source software, please read
[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
and other resources by [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide).
See [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section below for additional information.

## How can I Contribute?

If you wish to fix a bug, add a new feature or contest, provide documentation, develop training materials, or help in any way, these steps will get you started.

> The [atom editor project](https://www.github.com/atom/atom/) has provided some good content
[here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Their material applies to our project as well. Much of their material and text
has been reproduced below.

### Reporting Bugs (Opening an Issue)

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around
a feature idea or a bug.

TBD...
<br>
**Possible Source:** https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Suggesting Enhancements (or Contests)

TBD...
<br>
**Possible Source:** https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Your First Code Contribution (Opening a Pull Request and making changes)

1. **Select an issue** you would like to work on.
Change the [issue state](#issue-state) to "active" to indicate you are
actively working on this issue.
There is a [good first issue](#issue-attributes) label for issues that should be
ideal for people who are new to the MorseRunner project and code base.
 
1. [Fork the respository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and
clone it locally. Connect your local to the original "upstream" respository
by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay
up to date so when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
(See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).)

1. **Open a pull request** to track the work associated with the issue you have selected. See [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) below for more information.
Reference the issue # on which you are working.

1. [Create a branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for your changes.
Please follow the additional [developer guidelines](#developer-guidelines) below.

1. **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities.
This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would
in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge,
and for others to understand and maintain in the future.
See [developer guidelines](#developer-guidelines) below for more information.

1. [future] [Develop unit tests](#general-guidelines) to exercise the new
functionality. Some low-level code can be tested at the unit-test level.

1. Add a [changelog entry](#label-changelog) and update [Readme.txt](TODO) as appropriate.

### Pull Requests
A pull request is used to track work being done within the project.
When you start working on a specific issue, create a pull request and
indicate which issue you are working on.
Keep the PR update-to-date during your development to notify others of
your progress.
If a larger change, you can push your branch so others can have an early-look
at your changes.
When your work is complete, the PR will be submitted for review by one or
more of the reviewers.

1. **Reference any relavent issues** or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, "Closes #13.") Usually a PR has an associated Issue #.

1. **Include screen shots of the before and after** if your change involves changes to the UI.
Drag/drop the changes into your pull request.

1. **Test your changes!** Please test your changes to best extent possible as there is no formal
test plan or test suite for this project. Consider asking the issue's author if they are available
for early testing. If so, push your branch and let them test it.

1. **Send the completed pull request** when your work is complete.
This notifies the maintainer of your pending contribution who will in turn merge
and publish your changes.
This may be an iterative process if others have found issues or have recommendations for
additional changes.
   - [ ] TODO - verify that this is how the process actually works.

## Developer Guidelines
As contributors, we should adopt reasonable open source
development processes and conventions.
As a starting point, we can draw from www.opensource.guide.
These guidelines are recommendations, not rules. Please use your own judgement.

- [ ] TODO - identify other sources/examples of community development guidelines
and best practices for open source projects.
- [ ] TODO - pull in examples and table of contents from atom project (see below)

### General Guidelines
1. **Use feature branches.** Each enhancement should be developed on a separate feature branch.
Each branch can independently reviewed and tested before integration into main branch.
The idea is to keep each feature small and independent.
This is a common open source approach with multiple contributors and allows easy
code review and integration by other community members and maintainers.

1. **Open new issues.** whenever new unrelated problems or bugs are found during development.
Avoid going beyond the scope of the current problem when working on an issue.

1. **Unit Testing.** [future] When and where appropriate, develop [unit tests](#unit-testing)
to fully test low-level modules and if possible, show that a feature or behavior is
working as expected.
An example would be exercising the function that looks for a partial match of a
user-entered string against a given callsign.
   - [ ] TODO - develop unit test capability within Morse Runner.

1. **Code reviews** by other developers, project maintainers, and/or community members
should be performed on the feature branch as part of submitting the pull request.
Doing so will help maintain a solid code base.
Reviews also serve as a good way to learn details of the project.
Reviewers are looking for bugs and adherance to coding standards.
Additional code changes are often made after a review to incorporate suggested
improvementment and/or suggestions.
Some reviewers may even contribute specific code changes as part of the review.
Code reviews will typically occur near the end of development or after
submitting your PR (Pull Request) for review.
   - [ ] TODO - We need to define how/when the code review occurs.
Github has tools to facilitate code reviews.
We need to find and adopt these tools and perhaps setup a automated processes if possible.

1. **Code refactoring** is encouraged and should alway be performed independent of
feature development or bug fixing.
If working on a feature and you discover a refactoring opportunity,
please do this refactoring using a separate feature branch before completing
work on the current feature.

1. **Avoid reformatting of existing code** (e.g. changing indentation, if/then/else alignment, etc.).
Doing so make it really hard to merge and compare code.
    a. When modifying existing code, following the coding style of the original author.
    a. When writing a new module/unit, following recommended coding guidelines.
    a. Short term, we may remove code reformatting to make it easier to compare/merge code as needed.
    a. Long term, after most branches have been merged, we can consider code reformatting.

1. **Design Changes.** Please discuss any design changes with the project maintainers
before making these changes. If a pull request arrives without a prior discussion
regarding design or direction changes, the request will probably be denied.
We are open to design proposals and changes, but we do request that such changes
are discussed early. Please open an Issue do we can let the design discussion occur
and allow the design idea/proposal to evolve into something that we can agree to.

## Styleguides

### Changelog entries
- [ ] TODO - define how/where changelog entries are managed.
   a. If fixing a bug, mention the fix in the changelog file. TODO - what file?
   a. If adding a new feature, mention the enhancement in the changelog file.
   a. If appropriate, summarize the feature in Readme.txt.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to track and manage issues and pull requests.

GitHub search make it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests
you're interested in.
For example, you might be interested in beginner issues or perhaps open pull requests which
haven't been reviewed. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed
with a search link for finding open items with that label.
See [other search filters](TODO) which will help you write more focused queries.

We will grow these labels over time as we better understand this process and how to use them.
Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.
